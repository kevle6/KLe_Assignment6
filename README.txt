List of Source Files:

- word_occurrence.py


Code Limitations:

"word_occurrence.py" may not catch extra whitespace characters and may include them in the resulting "counts.txt" file. This will cause a line in the output file where whitespaces may count as "words." Please check to make sure there are no extra whitespaces. 

Deviations from Assignment Specifications:

Chapter 1 of Harry Potter is included in the zip file for testing purposes. The resulting "counts.txt" output file is included to show the final output file.
